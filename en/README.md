# Radio Bretzel

## Introduction
Radio Bretzel comes from a simple idea : some chat rooms where users could listen to the same music at the same time. Access to this rooms would be restricted, and playlists would be randomly generated from a collaborative pool of musics directly uploaded by users. Besides, shared audio banks from different users is a progressive way to collect metadata on artists or songs, giving to Radio Bretzel the role of a "Music Encyclopedia".
